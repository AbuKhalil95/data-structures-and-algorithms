# Reverse an Array
Done using a traditional for loop, and a spread operator first time, then switched to pure loop and array.

## Challenge
shift values by adding/removing a middle value to an array
## Approach & Efficiency
the spread operator made life much easier and straight forward, otherwise a length decrease and increase had to be considered.

## Solution
If statements to see if middle spot was reached, then adding/removing happens and the length afterwards is adjusted with another if statement.
